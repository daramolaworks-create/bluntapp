# Blunt
**Speak up. Stay safe.**
Blunt is a secure, privacy-focused platform for delivering difficult, sensitive, or high-risk messages safely — with optional anonymity, routing protection, and data-minimal storage principles.

## 🔥 What is Blunt?
Blunt exists for the truths that matter but are hard or dangerous to say:
- Workplace misconduct reporting
- Abuse disclosures
- Anonymous safety alerts
- Difficult personal truths
- Routing messages to HR, authorities, or trusted contacts — securely

Blunt provides a safe bridge between silence and action.

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy Philosophy
Blunt is built on **privacy-by-design** and **minimum data collection** principles.

- No persistent storage of message content on central servers
- Device-side storage for sensitive data where possible
- Time-bound message lifecycle
- Strong encryption in transit
- Zero unnecessary logging
- Clear, honest retention policy (not marketing fiction)

A public technical security paper will be released soon.
